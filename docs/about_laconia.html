							Laconia	borders on Messenia to the west and Arcadia to the north. Laconia is surrounded by the Myrtoan Sea to the east and the Laconian
							Gulf and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. It encompasses Cape Malea and Cape Tainaron and a large part of the Mani Peninsula.
							The islands of Kythira and Antikythera lie to the south, but they administratively belong to the regional unit of Islands. The
							island Elafonisos, situated between the Laconian mainland and Kythira, is part of Laconia.<br> The Evrotas is the longest
								river in the prefecture. The valley of the Evrotas is predominantly an agricultural region that contains many citrus
								groves, olive groves and pasture lands. It is the location of the largest orange production in the Peloponnese and probably
								all of Greece. The brand of orange juice named after this prefecture Lakonia is based in Amykles.<br> The main
									mountain ranges are the Taygetus (2,407 m) in the west and the Parnon (1,961 m) in the northeast. Taygetus, known as
									Pentadaktylos (five-fingers) throughout the Middle Ages, is west of Sparta and the Evrotas valley. It is the highest
									mountain in Laconia and the Peloponnese, and mostly covered with pine trees.

						<span style="font-weight: bold;">CLIMATE</span><br> Laconia
							has a Mediterranean climate with warm winters and hot summers.
							Snow is rare on the coast throughout the winter, but very common
							in the mountains.

							style="font-weight: bold;">ECONOMY
						</span>
						<br> The economy of
							Laconia is mainly rural. In the lowlands, agricultural production
							is concentrated on olive oil and citrus.. In the mountainous
							parts the main economic factor is farming, mainly that of dairy
							animals and poultry. In the prefecture small industrial
							enterprises processing agricultural products and manufacture
							juices are operated. Fishing, although highly developed in the
							Laconian Gulf, covers only the needs of the region. <br>
								Another economic resource of Laconia is internal and outdoor
								tourism. Rich and various natural and historical attractions of
								the area (Mani, Mystras, Monemvasia, Sparta, etc) attract many
								Greek and foreign visitors every year.

						<span
							style="font-weight: bold;">HISTORY</span><br> In ancient
							Greece this was the principal region of the Spartan state.
							Throughout classical antiquity the Spartan sphere of influence
							expanded to Messenia, whose inhabitants (the helots) were
							permanently enslaved. Significant archaeological recovery exists
							at the Vaphio tomb site in Laconia. Advanced Bronze Age art is
							found here and evidence of cultural associations with the
							co-temperaneous Minoan culture on Crete. Laconia was at war with
							the Kingdom of Macedonia and saw several battles; at the end of
							the Mycenean period population of Laconia declined sharply. From
							the early-2nd century BC until 395 it became a part of the Roman
							Empire.<br> In the medieval period, it formed part of the
								Byzantine Empire and following the Crusades it was the home of
								the Byzantine Despotate of Morea, held by the penultimate Greek
								ruling dynasty, the Palaiologoi. Laconia fell into the hands of
								the Ottomans but the Mani peninsula was mainly autonomous.<br>
									Laconia was liberated after the Greek War of Independence of
									1821 and after victory in battle, Sparta was selected capital
									of the modern prefecture; its economy and agriculture expanded.
									The country and the prefecture extended beyond the Laconia of
									ancient times, to Elafonissos in 1864, separating it from the
									British Empire and dissolving United States of the Ionian
									Islands. The island never had full Turkish rule; it was part of
									the Venetian Empire from the 15th century until the Napoleonic
									Wars. After World War II and the Greek Civil War, its
									population began to decline somewhat, as people moved from the
									villages toward the larger cities of Greece and abroad.
