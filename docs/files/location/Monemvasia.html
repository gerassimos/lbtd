		Monemvasia (Greek:
		&#924;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#956;&#946;&#945;&#963;&#943;&#945;) is a
		town and a municipality in Laconia, Greece. The town is located on a
		small peninsula off the east coast of the Peloponnese. The peninsula
		is linked to the mainland by a short causeway 200m in length. Its area
		consists mostly of a large plateau some 100 metres above sea level, up
		to 300 m wide and 1 km long, the site of a powerful medieval fortress.
		The town walls and many Byzantine churches remain from the mediaeval
		period. The seat of the municipality is the town Molaoi. <br>
