                 Driving south from Areopoli, it is 8 Km to the village of Pirgos Dirou, where the road forks off to the underground caves. The caves are 4Km further on from the main village, set beside the sea and a small beach (first picture). Glifada Caves are well-lit and crammed with stalactites where reflections are remarkable. Alepotrypa Caves are huge chambers in which excavations have unearthed evidence of prehistoric occupation. The caves are among the most important natural sites in Greece and with great archaeological significance.
